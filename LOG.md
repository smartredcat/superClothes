#### Why do I make ?
- I Just want to learn how a project created .

#### How did I make it ?

##### Day-1:
  - Create the vue@3 project.
  - Dispatch the project demo.
  - Add my project link my Github.
      > git remote add  origin git@.......
  - Install the vue@3 plugin such as vue-router, vuex@next and axios.
  - Clone the common normalize of the Css, And config my project.
  
  **Now let's try !**


##### Day-2:
  - Config the base Css.
  - Set the vue alias(vue.config.js)
  - Add the editorconfig(.enditorconfig file)
  - Config the TabBar and the NavBar
  - Config the router and network of the axios 
  - Render the axios function of the request URL
  - Try to the test url and return the data of the home@vue in the vue@components-data.
  - About the vue@devtool install, I used to install the devtool, but i failed, today,
    I'm reading the blog, He let me to install a App named "谷歌上网助手", then I install 
    it and search the vue@devtool to add my plugin, Finally, I succeeded. 
    
##### Day-3:
  - SlideShow emm.. I have a little failure. 
  - HomeRecommend@vue is ok.
  - HomePopular@vue is ok.
  - TabControl@vue  is a banner, just send a title object.
  - position: sticky;  The css is amazing !
    .isFixed {
        /* 当滚动44px  定位就变成fixed */
        position: sticky;
        top: 44px;
      }

##### Day-4: 
  -  I think the SliderShow is important and must be understood.
